### 5 What could Azure CLI change to improve its overall quality?

The following are customer verbatims (bolding applied post):
* "it's **hard to debug problems**, it's **hard to kill the process** (I get it the command is still running on azure, but for Linus Torvalds sake, give me back the terminal when I press ctrl+c), there are a lot of incoherencies between longa and short params (like --resource-group --group -r -g depends on the module)"
* "Sometimes, the command name is not very accurate, align with functionality"
* "**Fewer bugs**, higher parity with what's possible with the REST API and ARM templates, better consistency between components and the CLI args used"

* "Output formats"

### 10 Do you have any other recommendations, comments, questions, or concerns for the Azure CLI team?
