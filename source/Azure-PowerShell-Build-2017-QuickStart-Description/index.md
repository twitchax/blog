# Azure PowerShell Build 2017 QuickStart Description

This quickstart is designed to build awareness of Azure PowerShell and some of the features available in it.  
Before a user can get started, they will need a valid Azure subscription.  This quickstart assumes the user will have access to a Windows machine with PowerShell 5 or greater installed.  It is possible that this feature will not be enabled on all users accounts immediately.

In this challenge, users will:
* Create a VM and log into it.
* Provide feedback using the 'az feedback' command.

The quickstart is divided into multiple sections.
1. Make a command and change the format of outputs.
2. Find help and create your first resource group.
3. Create your first new VM while learning about new productivity features.
4. Log into your new VM while learning about some automation features.
5. Provide us feedback. 
6. **Delete** the resource group created.  If users do not complete this step, they will be billed for the ongoing usage.
